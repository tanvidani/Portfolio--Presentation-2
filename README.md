Relationship between Party performance across Constituencies in Maharashtra

This is a presentation created in R Markdown using the Xaringan template for creating presentations. I have chosen the dataset on Political parties and 3 constituencies candidates contest from for this project. The dataset is published by the Trivedi Center for Political data and I have filtered the data for only the state of Maharashtra, as I'm familiar with its politics due to living there for 19 years. 

The presentation includes comparisons of the number of candidates contesting local elections from all 3 constituencies and some graphs to better illustrate that. 

I hope this short presentation can provide some valuable insights on the influence of caste-reserved constituences in domestic elections of India.
